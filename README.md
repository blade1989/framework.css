framework.css
=============

Part reset, part normalize. It tries to be the very best, Like no css ever was. To catch visual inconsistencies is its real test, To train it is my cause.

I will travel across the HTML,
Searching for font-size and margin.
Each HTML tag to understand
The power that's inside

Framework, (gotta fix them all) its you and me
I know its my destiny
HTML TAGS, oh, you're my best css
In a world we must fix.

Framework, (gotta catch them all) a heart so true
Our courage will pull us through
You teach me and I'll teach you
(Fra-me-work) Gotta fix 'em all

Every challenge along the way
With courage I will face
I will battle every day
To claim my rightful place

Come with me, the time is right
There's no better team
Arm in arm we'll win the fight
It's always been our dream

Framework!

(Gotta fix 'em all)

It's you and me
I know it's my destiny

Framework!

Oh, you're my best friend,
In a world we must defend.

Framework!

A heart so true.
Our courage will pull us through.
You teach me and I'll teach you.

Framework!

(Gotta fix 'em all)x5

Pokemon!

It's you and me
I know it's my destiny

Framework!

Oh, you're my best friend,
In a world we must defend.

Pokemon!

A heart so true.
Our courage will pull us through.
You teach me and I'll teach you.

Framework!
Gotta fix em all!!
Gotta fix em all!!
Framework!!!
